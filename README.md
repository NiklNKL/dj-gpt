# instagram_scraping_and_analytics
This repo is for a student university project at the FHDW as part of the "Web- and Social-Media Analytics" Lecture of the Master's studies. 

# Run it locally
You can run it using the "UV" Package Manager.
Just install uv using pip install uv.

Then run uv sync to create a virtual environment with all the required packages.
Use either uv run or source .venv/bin/activate to launch the virtual environment.
Don't forget to select the venv as your interpreter.

You should now see the venv name in brackets in your terminal in front of every line.
The interpreter should be Python 3.12.

# Note
This repo will stop active development after 23/07/2025
